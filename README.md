# My algorithmic projects

## Contests

### [bernoulli](https://github.com/Siiir/Bernoulli)
my most interesting & creative calculator using **own optimizations** (**performs advanced math INCREADIBLY FAST**). It is specialized in partial sums.

### [knapsack](https://github.com/Siiir/rust-knapsack)
is a **my custom powerful** optimization over classic *brute-force* solution.
Searching through whole solution space it **will always find the optimal solution**.
Capable of cutting unpromising branches it **can handle enourmous data sets** as long as given `<CAPACITY>` is small.

### Dijkstra
Dijkstra projects awaits publishing.

### GigaFib
GigaFib projects needs digging out.
