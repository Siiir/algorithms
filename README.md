# My algorithmic projects

## Contents

### 🧮 [bernoulli](https://github.com/Siiir/Bernoulli) on Python3
My most interesting & creative calculator using **own optimizations** (**performs advanced math INCREDIBLY FAST**). It is specialized in partial sums.

### 🎒 [knapsack](https://github.com/Siiir/rust-knapsack) on Rust
A **custom powerful** optimization over classic *brute-force* solution.  
+ Searching through whole solution space, it **will always find the optimal solution**.  
+ Capable of cutting unpromising branches, it **can handle enormous data sets** as long as given `<CAPACITY>` is small.  

### 🐇 [General GG Fibonacci (GGGF)](https://github.com/Siiir/csharp-GGGF) on C#
**General**ized **G**enerator of **G**igantic **Fibonacci** numbers.  
Features: **Speed** – matrix based computation, **Accuracy** – perfectly correct output, **Flexibility** – negative indexes accepted.

### 🚀 Dijkstra
Dijkstra projects await publishing.
